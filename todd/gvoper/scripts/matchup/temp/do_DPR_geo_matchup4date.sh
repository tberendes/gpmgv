#  do_DPR_geo_matchup4date.sh    Morris/SAIC/GPM GV    April 2014
#
#
#  DESCRIPTION
#
#   Called by do_DPR_GeoMatch.sh, which generates the needed inputs.
#   Runs IDL in batch mode to generate GR-DPR matchups and write them to netCDF
#   files, for radar sites that are overpassed in each orbit for a specified
#   date (UTC) and have precipitation echoes.  Files, orbits, and overpassed
#   radar sites are listed in the provided filename whose YYMMDD date stamp
#   is provided as the first argument to this script.  The filename is set
#   as an environment variable so that IDL can extract the filename from the
#   environment.  The script tracks the status of data processing for the date
#   YYMMDD for each particular "kind" or matchup (algorithm/swath/version) via
#   entries in the 'appstatus' table in the 'gpmgv' database, and takes
#   appropriate actions according to the status of the date/kind's run.  The
#   "-f" option can override this status checking and force the matchup to be
#   run if set to the value 1.
#
#   By default, calls IDL with the batch file of commands to do normal (PPI) GR
#   matchups to DPR. If the -r option is specified with an argument value of 1,
#   then the batch file of commands to run the IDL procedure to do RHI matchups
#   to DPR will be called instead.
#
#   This script has a sleep/retry feature in case the IDL single-user license
#   is occupied by another user/process.  It will sleep 30 minutes between
#   attempts.  After 8 times hitting the Snooze button, it will give up and
#   flag the timed-out run to be reattempted the next time this script is run.
#
#
#  SYNOPSIS
#
#   do_DPR_geo_matchup4date.sh [OPTIONS]  YYMMDD  CONTROLFILE
#
#
#  OPTIONS/ARGUMENTS:
#
#   -f FORCE_MATCH - A command line option where FORCE_MATCH must be 0 or 1, be
#                    preceded by the "-f" option indicator, and must appear
#                    before the mandatory command line arguments.  If set to 1,
#                    then the matchups for the specified YYMMDD and control file
#                    are (re)processed regardless of the existing "appstatus"
#                    for the YYMMDD datestamp, i.e., a matchup is "forced" to be
#                    run.  If set to 0 or not specified, then the legacy behavior
#                    of checking appstatus against the YYMMDD, instrument, and
#                    swath combination before proceeding is used.  Default=0
#
#   -r DO_RHI      - A command line option where DO_RHI must be 0 or 1, must be
#                    preceded by the "-r" option indicator, and must appear
#                    before the mandatory command line arguments.  If set to 1
#                    then the script will run matchups to RHI data by calling
#                    IDL with the rhi2dpr.bat batch file.  If set to 0 or not
#                    specified, then the polar2dpr.bat file will be invoked in
#                    IDL to run matchups to PPI scans.
#
#   YYMMDD         - Mandatory argument, a single string listing the 2-digit year,
#                    month, and day of the site overpasses for which matchups are
#                    to be generated.  No validity checks are performed on the
#                    value of this date string, other than that it must fit
#                    within the database field 'datestamp'.
#
#   CONTROLFILE    - Mandatory argument, the fully qualified pathname of the IDL
#                    control file DPR_files_sites4geoMatch.TAG.txt, where TAG
#                    varies as described below.
#
#
#  ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
#
#   The following environment variables must be set and exported by the caller
#   so that they are defined and available to this script:
#
#   GV_BASE_DIR - Partial top-level path to IDL batch file to be run.
# PARAMETER_SET - Version of the IDL batch file to be run.
#       TMP_DIR - Path to temporary files used in this and the calling script.
#       LOG_DIR - Path to log files used in this and the calling script.
#
#
#  FILES
#
#   DPR_files_sites4geoMatch.TAG.txt (INPUT)
#                            - lists data files, orbits, and NEXRAD sites
#                              overpassed in each orbit on date YYMMDD.  TAG is
#                              a combination of parameters that indicate the 
#                              DPR 2A product algorithm (e.g. DPR or Ka), the
#                              DPR scan type to be used (HS, MS, or NS), the PPS
#                              version of the 2A product (e.g., V03C), and the
#                              YYMMDD of the data listed in the control file.
#                            - This script only checks for the existence of the
#                              file and passes its pathname to IDL via setting
#                              the environment variable CONTROLFILE.
#
#   polar2dpr_V.bat or rhi2dpr_V.bat (EXTERNAL)
#                            - Batch file of IDL commands to be run, where
#                              V is defined by the value of $PARAMETER_SET,
#                              e.g., polar2dpr_1.bat.
#
#
#  DATABASE
#
#    Status of this script's runs are maintained in the 'appstatus' table,
#    in rows tagged with the app_id attribute value 'geo_match_${kind}', 
#    where 'kind' is a combination of DPR 2A product algorithm and scan type
#    extracted from TAG in the control file name, e.g., 'KaMS'.
#
#
#  LOGS
#
#    Output for script run is logged to file do_DPR_geo_matchup4date.yymmdd.log
#    in the $LOG_DIR directory, where 'yymmdd' is the date of the input data,
#    unless improper number of arguments are passed. In this case the error is
#    logged to the current-date-tagged file do_DPR_geo_matchup.yymmdd.fatal.log
#    in $LOG_DIR, where 'yymmdd' is for the date the script run was attempted,
#    not the input data date.
#
#
#  RETURN VALUES
#
#    0 = normal, successfully created new matchup files
#    1 = error in processing or no input data; no matchup files created
#    2 = already successfully ran matchups for this date, do nothing
#
#
#  CONSTRAINTS
#
#    - User under which script is run must have access privileges to PostGRESQL
#      database 'gpmgv', and SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT privileges on tables. 
#    - PostGRESQL utility 'psql' must be in user's $PATH.
#    - User must have write privileges in $TMP_DIR, $LOG_DIR directories, as
#      well as the directory tree to which the output netCDF files will be
#      written (see the IDL '.bat' files and the polar2dpr documentation).
#    - Calling process must set and export GV_BASE_DIR, TMP_DIR, LOG_DIR, and
#      PARAMETER_SET.
#    - The IDL PATH to the required IDL code or precompiled binaries should be
#      configured for the user running this script or errors may occur.
#
#  HISTORY
#
#  2/15/2017   Morris   - Added logic to use PARAMETER_SET environment variable
#                         value to define the version of the polar2dpr ".bat"
#                         file to be run by IDL.
#                       - Changed IDL_PRO_DIR to ${GV_BASE_DIR}/idl/geo_match
#                         for user gvoper.
