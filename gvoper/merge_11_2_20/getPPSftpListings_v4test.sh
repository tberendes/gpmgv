# getPPSftpListings_v4test.sh    Morris/SAIC/GPM GV    April 2014
#
# DESCRIPTION:
#
# Uses Perl script 'mirror' to create a local mirror of the PPS ftp location
# where ftp_url_YYMMDDHHMM.txt listing files for new Internal Test and
# Evaluation (ITExxx, xxx=001,002,...) PPS products are located.  Makes up to 10
# attempts to access the ftp site and download all the files not present in the
# local directory, $MIR_DATA_DIR.  Examines MIR_LOG_FILE to determine whether
# any errors occurred in the last run of mirror, and if so, makes a retry after
# a sleep period.
#
# FILES:
#
#                  mirror - Perl script to perform the directory mirroring via
#                           ftp.  Freeware download.
#
#         mirror.defaults - Default configuration items for mirror script.  Used
#                           by mirror but not referenced in this script.  May be
#                           augmented and/or overridden by package file.
#
# arthurhou.pps.eosdis.nasa.gov.v4test - Package file, holds configuration for
#                           mirror script to mirror ITE files from PPS ftp site.
#
#        pps_ftp_lists.log - Log file of mirror script.  Is examined to determine
#                           if download errors require mirror to be re-run.
#                           Is renamed mirror.YYMMDD.log and moved from
#                           $MIR_DATA_DIR to $LOG_DIR at end of script run.
#
#  DATABASE
#    Catalogs PPS subset file metadata in orbit_subset_product table in 'gpmgv'
#    database in PostGRESQL via call to psql utility.
#
#  LOGS
#    Output for day's script run logged to daily log file
#    getPPSftpListings.YYYYMMDD.log in data/logs subdirectory. 
#    YYYYMMDD is replaced by the current date.
#
#  CONSTRAINTS
#    - User under which script is run must have access privileges to PostGRESQL
#      database 'gpmgv', and INSERT privileges on table.  Utility 'psql' must
#      be in user's $PATH.
#    - User must have write privileges in $MIR_DATA_DIR, $LOG_DIR directories
#
