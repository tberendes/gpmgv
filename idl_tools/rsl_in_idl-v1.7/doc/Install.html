<h2>Installing RSL in IDL</h2>
<pre>
Untar the package:

  tar xf rsl_in_idl-v1.7.tar

cd to the package directory and run the script 'rslinstall':

  cd rsl_in_idl-v1.7
  rslinstall

This installs rsl_in_idl library in $HOME/idl/rsl_in_id/.  If you want to
install in a different directory, give the full path name as an argument to
rslinstall.  For example:

  rslinstall $HOME/thisdir

If the target directory already exits, rslinstall will prompt you for
permission to overwrite it.  If you don't want to be prompted, use the '-f'
option.  The following installs rsl_in_idl in the target directory while
silently overwriting existing files with the same names.

  rslinstall -f 


To complete installation, add the rsl_in_idl directory to IDL's search path.

One way to do this is to set the IDL_PATH preference within IDL:

  pref_set, 'IDL_PATH', '&lt;IDL_DEFAULT&gt;:/home/yourid/idl/rsl_in_idl', /commit

You need only do this once as IDL Preferences are retained between sessions.

Note that '&lt;IDL_DEFAULT&gt;' is a symbolic name for the IDL distribution
directories, and should always be included when setting IDL_PATH.

Another way to set IDL_PATH is via the environment variable of the
same name.  You can do this in your shell initialization file
(.bashrc, .tcshrc, etc.) using one of the following commands, depending on
your shell:

# bash or ksh:
  export IDL_PATH='&lt;IDL_DEFAULT&gt;:/home/yourid/idl/rsl_in_idl'

# tcsh or csh:
  setenv IDL_PATH '&lt;IDL_DEFAULT&gt;:/home/yourid/idl/rsl_in_idl'
