#  do_DPR2GR_geo_matchup4date_v7.sh    Morris/SAIC/GPM GV    March 2016
#
#
#  DESCRIPTION
#
#   Called by do_DPR2GR_GeoMatch.sh, which generates the needed configurations.
#   Runs IDL in batch mode to generate DPR matchups to previously-volume-matched
#   GR data in "GRtoDPR_HS_FS" netCDF files, and writes them to netCDF
#   files, for radar sites that are overpassed in each orbit for a specified
#   date (UTC) and have precipitation echoes.  Files, orbits, and overpassed
#   radar sites are listed in the provided filename whose YYMMDD date stamp
#   is provided as the first argument to this script.  The filename is set
#   as an environment variable so that IDL can extract the filename from the
#   environment.  The script tracks the status of data processing for the date
#   YYMMDD for each particular "kind" or matchup (algorithm/swath/version) via
#   entries in the 'appstatus' table in the 'gpmgv' database, and takes
#   appropriate actions according to the status of the date/kind's run.  The
#   "-f" option can override this status checking and force the matchup to be
#   run if set to the value 1.
#
#
#  ARGUMENTS
#
#   -f FORCE_MATCH - A command line option whose value must be 0 or 1, must be
#                    preceded by the "-f" option indicator, and must appear
#                    before the other two command line arguments.  If set to 1
#                    then the matchups for the specified YYMMDD and control file
#                    are (re)processed regardless of the existing "appstatus"
#                    for the YYMMDD datestamp, i.e., a matchup is "forced" to be
#                    run.  If set to 0 or not specified, then the legacy behavior
#                    of checking appstatus against the YYMMDD, instrument, and
#                    swath combination before proceeding is used.  Default=0
#
#   -r DO_RHI      - A command line option whose value must be 0 or 1, must be
#                    preceded by the "-r" option indicator, and must appear
#                    before the other two command line arguments.  If set to 1
#                    then the script will run matchups to RHI data by calling
#                    IDL with the TBD_RHI.bat batch file.  If set to 0 or not
#                    specified, the dpr2gr_prematch_v7.bat file will be invoked in
#                    IDL to run matchups to PPI scans.  THIS OPTION IS NOT YET
#                    SUPPORTED AS THERE CURRENTLY IS NO CAPABILITY FOR THE
#                    GR RHI MATCHUP TO MULTIPLE DPR SCAN TYPES AT ONCE.
#
#   YYMMDD - A single string listing the 2-digit year, month, and day of the
#            site overpasses for which matchups are to be generated.  No validity
#            checks are performed on the value of this date string, other than
#            that it must fit within the database field 'datestamp'.
#
#   CONTROLFILE - Fully qualified pathname of the IDL control file
#                 DPR_files_sites4geoMatch.TAG.txt.  See FILES, below.
#
#
#  ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
#
#   The following environment variables must be set and exported by the caller
#   so that they are defined and available to this script:
#
#   GV_BASE_DIR - Partial top-level path to IDL batch file to be run.
# PARAMETER_SET - Version of the IDL batch file to be run.
#       TMP_DIR - Path to temporary files used in this and the calling script.
#       LOG_DIR - Path to log files used in this and the calling script.
#
#
#  FILES
#
#   DPR_files_sites4geoMatch.TAG.txt (INPUT)
#                            - lists data files, orbits, and NEXRAD sites
#                              overpassed in each orbit on date YYMMDD.  TAG is
#                              a combination of parameters that indicate the 
#                              DPR 2A product algorithm (e.g. DPR or Ka), the
#                              DPR scan type to be used ("All" only), the PPS
#                              version of the 2A product (e.g., V03C), and the
#                              YYMMDD of the data listed in the control file.
#
#   dpr2gr_prematch_v7_V.bat (EXTERNAL)
#                            - Batch file of IDL commands to be run, where
#                              V is defined by the value of $PARAMETER_SET,
#                              e.g., dpr2gr_prematch_v7_1.bat.
#
#
#  DATABASE
#
#    Status of this script's runs are maintained in the 'appstatus' table,
#    in rows tagged with the app_id attribute value 'geo_match${kind}', where
#    the value 'kind' depends on the type of DPR 2A data being processed.
#
#
#  LOGS
#
#    Output for script run is logged to file do_DPR2GR_geo_matchup4date_v7.yymmdd.log
#    in the $LOG_DIR directory, where 'yymmdd' is the input data date,
#    unless improper number of arguments are passed. In this case the error is
#    logged to the current-date-tagged file do_DPR_geo_matchup.yymmdd.fatal.log
#    in $LOG_DIR, where 'yymmdd' is for the date the script run was attempted,
#    not the input data date.
#
#
#  RETURN VALUES
#
#    0 = normal, successfully created new matchup files
#    1 = error in processing or no input data; no matchup files created
#    2 = already successfully ran matchups for this date, do nothing
#
#
#  CONSTRAINTS
#
#    - User under which script is run must have access privileges to PostGRESQL
#      database 'gpmgv', and SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT privileges on tables. 
#      Utility 'psql' must be in user's $PATH.
#    - User must have write privileges in $TMP_DIR, $LOG_DIR directories
#    - Calling process must set and export GV_BASE_DIR, TMP_DIR, LOG_DIR
#
#  HISTORY
#    - 10/4/2016 - Replaced app_id prefix 'geo_match_' with 'geo_match' so that
#                  the longest app_id 'geo_matchDPRAll' fits within the 15
#                  character limit for the app_id column in the appstatus table.
#    - 2/15/2017 - Added logic to use PARAMETER_SET environment variable
#                  value to define the version of the dpr2gr_prematch_v7 ".bat"
#                  file to be run by IDL.
#      1/24/20:    Berendes   FORCE_MATCH default set to "1" and removed FORCE_MATCH
#                         clause from final check that causes DB field to be 
#                         set to "missing" if FORCE_MATCH is used.  I believe this
#                         is a pre-existing bug, and the date check is unnecessary 
#                         in our current processing scheme since the parent script
#                         checks for duplicates on each processing date and doesn't 
#                         add duplicates to the control file unless -f is used
#                         in parent script.
