#  do_GMI_geo_matchup4date_v7.sh    Morris/SAIC/GPM GV    May 2011
#
#
#  DESCRIPTION
#
#   Called by do_GMI_GeoMatch.sh, which generates the needed inputs.
#   Runs IDL in batch mode to generate GV-GMI matchups and write them to netCDF
#   files, for radar sites that are overpassed in each orbit for a specified
#   date (UTC) and have precipitation echoes.  Files, orbits, and overpassed
#   radar sites are listed in the well-known filename of the control file whose
#   YYMMDD date stamp is specified as the single argument to this script.
#   The control file's complete pathname is built and exported by this script
#   as an environment variable so that IDL can extract the filename from the
#   environment.  The script tracks the status of data processing for the date
#   YYMMDD via entries in the 'appstatus' table in the 'gpmgv' database, and
#   takes appropriate actions according to the status of the date's run.
#
#   This script has a sleep/retry feature in case the IDL single-user license
#   is occupied by another user/process.  It will sleep 30 minutes between
#   attempts.  After 8 times hitting the Snooze button, it will give up and
#   flag the timed-out run to be reattempted the next time this script is run.
#
#
#  SYNOPSIS
#
#   do_GMI_geo_matchup4date_v7.sh  CONTROLFILE
#
#
#  ARGUMENTS
#
#   YYMMDD - Mandatory argument, datestamp of the fully qualified pathname of
#            the IDL control file GMI_files_sites4geoMatch_v7.YYMMDD.txt, where
#            YYMMDD varies as described below.  The full pathname to the control
#            file is formatted by this script using the same rules as in the
#            calling script, do_GMI_GeoMatch.sh.
#
#
#  ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
#
#   The following environment variables must be set and exported by the caller
#   so that they are defined and available to this script:
#
#   GV_BASE_DIR - Partial top-level path to IDL batch file to be run.
#       TMP_DIR - Path to temporary files used in this and the calling script.
#       LOG_DIR - Path to log files used in this and the calling script.
#
#
#  FILES
#
#   GMI_files_sites4geoMatch_v7.YYMMDD.txt (INPUT)
#                            - lists data files, orbits, ground radar sites, and
#                              required metadata for ground radars overpassed in
#                              the rainy orbits on date YYMMDD, in the format
#                              required by the IDL polar2gmi procedure.
#                            - This script only checks for the existence of the
#                              file and passes its pathname to IDL via setting
#                              the environment variable CONTROLFILE.
#
#   polar2gmi_v7.bat (EXTERNAL) - Batch file of IDL commands to be run.
#
#
#  DATABASE
#
#    Status of this script's runs are maintained in the 'appstatus' table,
#    in rows tagged with the app_id attribute value 'geo_match_gmi'.
#
#
#  LOGS
#
#    Output for script run is logged to file do_GMI_geo_matchup4date_v7.yymmdd.log
#    in the $LOG_DIR directory, where 'yymmdd' is the input data date,
#    unless improper number of arguments are passed. In this case the error is
#    logged to the current-date-tagged file do_GMI_geo_matchup.yymmdd.fatal.log
#    in $LOG_DIR, where 'yymmdd' is for the date the script run was attempted,
#    not the input data date.
#
#
#  RETURN VALUES
#
#    0 = normal, successfully created new matchup files
#    1 = error in processing or no input data; no matchup files created
#    2 = already successfully ran matchups for this date, do nothing
#
#
#  CONSTRAINTS
#
#    - User under which script is run must have access privileges to PostGRESQL
#      database 'gpmgv', and SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT privileges on tables. 
#      Utility 'psql' must be in user's $PATH.
#    - User must have write privileges in $TMP_DIR, $LOG_DIR directories
#
#  HISTORY
#
#  07/17/17  Morris     - Modified to take YYMMDD as the single argument in
#                         place of the full pathname of the control file.
